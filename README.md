# ID++ Protocol

<!-- @format -->

## Introduction

This repository contains ID++ a reference implementation of Decentralized Web Node (DWN) as per the [specification](https://identity.foundation/decentralized-web-node/spec/). This specification is in a draft state and very much so a WIP. For the foreseeable future, a lot of the work on DWN will be split across this repo and the repo that houses the specification.

Proposals and issues for the specification itself should be submitted as pull requests.
