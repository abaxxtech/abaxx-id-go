This is the legal agreement between Xco (the “Trustor”/“Borrower”) and Abaxx Technologies Inc. (the “Trustee”/“Lender”). It sets up a structure where Xco pledges gold bars as collateral to Abaxx, who holds them in trust and provides a line of credit (a margin lending facility) to Xco. The agreement uses blockchain technology to track and manage the digital rights to the gold bars. Password is Cft#$78

Essentially --Xco owns gold bars and wants to borrow money using those bars as collateral. Abaxx holds the gold bars (or the digital rights to them) in trust and lends money to Xco, secured by the gold. The transfer of rights and the status of the collateral are tracked using blockchain and smart contracts. If Xco defaults, Abaxx can sell the gold bars or otherwise enforce its rights. The agreement covers all the legal, technical, and operational details for this arrangement.

The key to this agreement is that it is essentially and always a trust indenture document and there are exceptionally detailed needs that are required to define and administrate this trust relationship. Most trust documents are at least 80 to 150 pages as each aspect of the trustee relationship must be anticipated and the ability and rules to deal with its set out—that and the fact you are tacking on the ability to facilitate margin lending are why this is a lengthy document. There are no short cuts in the legal relationships between the parties. This agreement is a hybrid between a security agreement (pledging collateral) and a trust arrangement, with a line of credit built in. It is highly detailed to address legal, technical, and operational risks.

What is up for discussion is the technology used and the way its described mostly in section 3 and obviously referred to throughout. This document camps on my blockchain client documents from 2015 to 2018 where I did work for many digital providers of payment and lending schemas in the crypto environment, It uses blockchain and smart contracts to automate and record key actions.

Quite simply: the technology we will use for this digital pilot project is not going to be the same but the same hierarchical structure of describing and using blockchain technology for this purpose is transposed and clearly, it may not be applicable in many ways. Thus section 3 and its interactions throughout the document are variable, but the relationship debtor creditor and trustee provisions of this document are germane and needed whether this was a digital or analog pilot. Bottom line: I am no expert in the tech you will use so the provisions of section 3 are variable and discretionary, but the majority of the document is not.

I originally had a long and short version of the document I used when creating a drafting plan, but quite frankly this is irrelevant to this master document and would only mislead an understanding. Instead I have provided a summary below of the document, each section is designed to clarify the parties’ rights, obligations, and what happens in various scenarios (borrowing, repayment, default, termination). Please do not under any circumstance disseminate this document outside of this group thanks. J

Here is the Section-by-Section purpose or explanation and step process of the Doc:

1. Definitions

This section provides precise meanings for all key terms used throughout the agreement. It covers legal, technical, and financial terms (like “Collateral,” “Digital Asset Rights,” “Smart Contract,” “Event of Default,” etc.), ensuring there’s no ambiguity about what each term means. This is critical for interpreting the rest of the agreement and for resolving any disputes about terminology.

2. Grant of Trust and Security Interest

This section explains how Xco (the Trustor) transfers its gold bars (and the digital rights to those bars) to Abaxx (the Trustee/Lender) as collateral for the loan. It details:

The legal structure of the transfer (not an outright sale, but a security interest/trust arrangement).
The process for perfecting the security interest (making it legally enforceable, including UCC filings).
The use of blockchain and smart contracts to record and manage the digital rights to the collateral.
The obligations secured by the collateral (repayment, interest, fees, compliance, etc.).
The procedures for verifying and valuing the collateral, including documentation, inspection, and insurance requirements.
3. Core Technology Implementation

This section sets out the technical framework for using blockchain and smart contracts in the transaction—as stated this is an estimation of process based on previous digitization’s . It covers:

How digital tokens representing the gold bars are created, transferred, and tracked.
The technical standards and security protocols for the blockchain and smart contracts.
How oracles (external data feeds) are used for things like gold price updates and vault verification.
Key management and access controls (who holds the private keys, how they’re secured).
Procedures for upgrades, governance, and what happens if the technology fails or is compromised.
How disputes about the technology are resolved, and how records are maintained and audited.
4. Rights and Obligations of Parties

This section spells in finite and detail as required-----what each party must do and what rights they have. For Xco, this includes:

Maintaining the gold in good condition and in compliance with laws.
Providing regular reports, notifications, and access for inspection.
Keeping insurance and records up to date. For Abaxx, it includes:
The right to hold and control the digital asset rights.
The right to inspect, audit, and enforce the security interest.
The right to make margin calls and exercise remedies if Xco defaults. It also covers mutual cooperation, confidentiality, and force majeure (unexpected events).
5. Margin Lending

This section describes how the line of credit works (noting that there is a separate Line of Credit doc – see Exhibit 1), including:

How the credit facility is established, the maximum amount, and the term.
The process for requesting advances, the conditions that must be met, and how funds are disbursed.
How interest is calculated and paid.
How the value of the collateral is determined and monitored (including margin calls if the value drops).
What happens if the loan-to-value ratio is breached (margin call or liquidation).
The fees and expenses involved.
What constitutes an event of default specific to the lending arrangement, and the remedies available to the lender.
6. Default and Remedies

This section details how we deal with a default :

What events constitute a default (missed payments, breach of covenants, insolvency, etc.).
The process for declaring a default and accelerating the loan (making everything due immediately).
The remedies available to Abaxx, including selling the collateral, collecting insurance, appointing a receiver, or using the smart contract to enforce rights automatically.
How proceeds from collateral sales are applied, and what happens if there’s a deficiency or surplus.
The cumulative nature of remedies (using more than one at a time), and the rights of third parties.
7. Termination

This section explains:

How and when the agreement can be terminated by either party (voluntarily, for cause, or automatically).
The steps required for termination, including notice, repayment of all obligations, and release of the security interest.
The process for returning the collateral or transferring the digital asset rights back to Xco.
What happens if only part of the collateral is released (partial termination).
Which provisions survive termination (e.g., indemnification, confidentiality, payment of fees).
The documentation required to evidence termination.
8. Representations and Warranties

Both parties make legally binding promises about their authority, ownership, compliance with laws, and the accuracy of information provided. For Xco, this includes confirming it owns the gold, the gold is free of other claims, and it is in compliance with all relevant laws. For Abaxx, it includes confirming it is properly licensed and authorized. If any of these statements are untrue, it can trigger a default.

9. Indemnification

This section allocates responsibility for losses, claims, or damages. Xco agrees to cover Abaxx for losses arising from breaches, misrepresentations, or third-party claims related to the collateral or the transaction. Abaxx also provides indemnities to Xco for its own breaches or misconduct. The section also covers procedures for making indemnity claims, subrogation, and mitigation.

10. Miscellaneous

This is mostly “boilerplate” , covering:

Governing law (Barbados), and how disputes are resolved (negotiation, mediation, arbitration).
How notices are given.
Assignment rights (who can transfer their rights/obligations).
Severability (what happens if part of the agreement is invalid).
Waivers, electronic signatures, and record-keeping.
Force majeure (what happens if performance is prevented by events outside the parties’ control).
The relationship of the parties (not partners or agents), and no third-party beneficiaries.
11. Execution

Signature blocks for both parties to sign, making the agreement legally binding.

Schedules and Exhibits

Schedule A – Line of Credit Agreement: Sets out the specific commercial terms for each credit facility (amount, interest rate, maturity, etc.), and links back to the main agreement for all other terms—again note there are two agreements that interact.
Exhibit 1 – Advance Request Form: The template Xco uses to request a loan advance, specifying the amount, date, purpose, and disbursement instructions.
